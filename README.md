## JAMstack E Commerce Professional

This project provides a way to quickly get up and running with a fully configurable JAMstack E Commerce site.

Out of the box, the site uses completely static data coming from a provider at `providers/inventoryProvider.js`. You can update this provider to fetch data from any real API by changing the call in the `getInventory` function.
